# TTC
Transformer-based TDE Classifier (TTC) is a time-domain classification algorithm for tidal disruption events (TDEs), based on Mgformer. Related work is currently in preparation.

The TTC consists of two parts: function Fitting (Curved-fitting Filter,CFF) and algorithm scoring (Transformer ML Filter).
